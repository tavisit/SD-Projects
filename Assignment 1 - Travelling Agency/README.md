# Specifications

The goal of this project is to design and implementation of a vacation seeking application having the following criteria:
Now, the application needs to accommodate only 2 types of users (lucky you):
* Regular User/Vacay seeker
* Travelling Agency

The Travelling Agency should be able to:

1. add vacation destination
2. add vacation packages for a specific destination
a. should contain information: name, price, period, extra details, number
of people that can book the vacation
3. edit an existing vacation package
4. delete an existing vacation package
5. view all its listed vacation packages (with status: BOOKED, NOT_BOOKED,
IN_PROGRESS)
6. delete vacation destination

The Regular User should be able to:

1. register on the platform using some credentials (username/email - unique &
password)
2. login on the platform
3. view all available vacation packages
4. filter vacation packages by destination/price/period
5. book a vacation
6. view all its booked vacations

# Conclusions

The application taught me how to build a layered application using databases. In the same time, it taught me how to respect stakeholder's criteria and how to manage my time
